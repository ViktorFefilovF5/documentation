{{<call-out "caution" "Data plane key guidelines" "fas fa-key" >}}
Data plane keys are displayed only once and cannot be retrieved later. Be sure to copy and store this key securely.

Data plane keys expire after one year. You can change this expiration date by [editing the key]({{< ref "nginx-one/connect-instances/create-manage-data-plane-keys.md#change-expiration-date" >}}).

Your NGINX instances stay connected as long as the data plane key is active. If:

- You [revoke a data plane key]({{< ref "nginx-one/connect-instances/create-manage-data-plane-keys.md#revoke-data-plane-key" >}}) 
- A data plane key expires

That disconnects all instances that were registered with that key.
