{{< call-out "warning" "Information architecture note" >}}

The design intention for this page is to detail the F5 support policies and other important information a customer might know.

Some existing content that would be moved to this page are the "_Opening a Support Ticket_" information from [v4]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/troubleshooting-guide/troubleshooting.md#opening-a-support-ticket" >}}) and [v5]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v5/troubleshooting-guide/troubleshooting.md#opening-a-support-ticket">}}).

There's lots of examples of existing support pages, some of which may have includes available for re-use:

- [NGINX Instance Manager - Where to go for support]({{< ref "/nim/support/contact-support.md" >}})
- [NGINX Agent - Support]({{< ref "/agent/support.md" >}})
- [NGINX Ingress Controller - Commercial support]({{< ref "/nic/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-support.md" >}})
