{{< call-out "warning" "Information architecture note" >}}

The design intention for this page is to act as a standalone page for the [Converter Tool Docker Image]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/admin-guide/install.md#converter-tool-docker-image" >}}) and Converter tools instructions.

- [v4 Converter tools]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/configuration-guide/configuration.md#converter-tools" >}})
- [v5 Converter tools]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v5/configuration-guide/configuration.md#converter-tools" >}})

There are slight differences between the v4 and v5 tool, which will be clearly denoted using tabs or another mechanism. 

The instructions are relatively short, so keeping all the context of building and using them in one place contains them as a discrete use case.
