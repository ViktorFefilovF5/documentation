{{< call-out "warning" "Information architecture note" >}}

The design intention for this page is to act as a new place for the v5 [NGINX App Protect WAF Compiler]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v5/admin-guide/compiler.md">}}) page.

Information that isn't critically important to a specific task should be moved to its own page. This page is a good example of one that doesn't need to be broken up, but is still moved into a peripheral "Tools" section for when it is necessary.
