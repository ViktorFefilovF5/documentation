{{< call-out "warning" "Information architecture note" >}}

The design intention for this page is to act as a single reference point for what has previously existed in documentation as [Declarative Policy]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/declarative-policy/policy.md" >}}).

Like many other pages, a lot of the information was duplicated - this provides a single source of truth, and supports the Policy section by having all of the context for policies close together.
