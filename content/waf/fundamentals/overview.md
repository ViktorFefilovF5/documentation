{{< call-out "warning" "Information architecture note" >}}

The design intention for this page is to describing what NGINX App Protect is, expanding on the detail from the [landing page]({{< ref "/waf/" >}}).

It is also an opportunity to explain the difference between NGINX App Protect versions, and how integrates with other products in the NGINX ecosystem.

The text here will likely be synthesized from the Overview descriptions at the top of the [Administration Guides]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/admin-guide/install.md#overview" >}}), but there's also detail from [F5.com](https://www.f5.com/products/nginx/nginx-app-protect) that can be added.
