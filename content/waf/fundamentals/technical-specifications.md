{{< call-out "warning" "Information architecture note" >}}

The design intention for this page is to act as a single source of truth for supported operating systems and version compatibility.

It follows a design pattern set by other NGINX product sets, showing various compatibility matrices:

- [NGINX Plus]({{< ref "/nginx/technical-specs.md" >}})
- [NGINX Instance Manager]({{< ref "/nim/fundamentals/tech-specs.md" >}})
- [NGINX Ingress Controller]({{< ref "/nic/technical-specifications.md" >}})

It is also where information about the [Supported Security Policy Features]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/configuration-guide/configuration.md#supported-security-policy-features" >}}) could be referenced, though most of that detail will instead be kept in the new top-level "Policies" section.
