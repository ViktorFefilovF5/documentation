{{< call-out "warning" "Information architecture note" >}}

The design intention for this page is as a standalone page for the operating system specific installation use cases:

- [v4]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v4/admin-guide/install.md#prerequisites" >}})
- [v5]({{< ref "/nap-waf/v5/admin-guide/install.md#common-steps-for-nginx-open-source-and-nginx-plus" >}})

Instead of having separate top level folders, differences between v4 and v5 will be denoted with whole page sections, tabs, or other unique signifiers.

This page describes how to install F5 WAF for NGINX on a virtual machine or bare metal environment. To review supported operating systems, please read the [Technical specifications]({{< ref "/waf/fundamentals/technical-specifications.md" >}}) guide.

There are multiple alternative deployment methods available:

- [Deploy F5 WAF for NGINX using Docker]({{< ref "/waf/install/docker.md" >}})
- [Deploy F5 WAF for NGINX using Kubernetes]({{< ref "/waf/install/kubernetes.md" >}})
- [Deploy F5 WAF for NGINX in a disconnected environment]({{< ref "/waf/install/disconnected-environment.md" >}})

F5 WAF for NGINX can be installed as a module for an existing NGINX Plus installation or installed alongside NGINX Plus in a new environment.
